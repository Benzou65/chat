# BenzouAi Chat

This is a side project to test the new app dir of Next.js 13, Vercel [ai SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) and also [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/). Kind of ChatGPT with a Messenger interface. Nothing crazy.

## Requirements

- Node 20.11.1
- npm 10.2.4

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

   `npm install`

2. Generate design system code:

   `npm run prepare`

3. Create a `.env.local` file similar to `.env.example` with your own credentials.

4. Then run the development server:

   `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
