This is a side project to test the new app dir of Next.js 13, Vercel [ai SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) and also [Panda CSS](https://panda-css.com/). Kind of ChatGPT with a Messenger interface. Nothing crazy.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
